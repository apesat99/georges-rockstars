        <h1>George's Story</h1>
        <p>George O'Shaughnessy was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
          in November 2014, aged just 22 months old. George started a 3 and a half
          year chemotherapy treatment plan but relapsed 2 years into treatment.
          He then underwent high dose chemotherapy, cranial and total body radiation and
          a bone marrow transplant, spending many months at a time in hospital,
          often over a hundred miles from home. Sadly 10 months after his bone marrow transplant
          George relapsed again and his only option for a cure was to take part
          in a trial for pioneering CAR T Cell therapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital. After initially
          responding very well and achieving remission for the third time and finally being given the go ahead to start school
          a year and a half late, 10 months after his CAR T cell
          therapy, George's bone marrow devestaingly showed his leukaemia was returning for the fourth time which
          meant George would not be able to be cured. George spent precious time at home with his family,
          Mum Amy, Dad Craig and younger sister Bella and passed away at home surrounded by his loving family 4 months
          later in August 2019.
          Despite all that life threw at him and spending a huge amount of his short childhood in hospitals,
          George was well known for his cheeky personality and happy smile. He loved music and hugely benefitted
          from music therapy while in isolation for his bone marrow transplant at Bristol Children's Hospital.
          The positive impact of his music therapy sessions led George's parents to set up the charity in his
          memory to provide music therapy on childrens hospital wards in the UK and improve the lives and
          experiences of children who often have to spend much of their childhood in hospital.</p>
